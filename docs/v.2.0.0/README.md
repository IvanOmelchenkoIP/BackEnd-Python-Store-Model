# BackEnd V.2.0.0

## Task

- Add data validation
- Add error handling
- Add ORM models
- Add functionality by variant

### Functionality By Variant:

Group number - IP-04

04 mod 3 = 1

**Variant 1.** Add currency

#### Currency:

- Add Currency entity
- Default currency can be added for every user
- When creating a record, a currency can be set, but it is not mandatory
- If a record was not set when creating a record, a default currency of a user will be used

#### Resulting Data Structure Used In Solution:

| Currency      |
| ------------- |
| id            |
| currency name |

| User        |
| ----------- |
| id          |
| user name   |
| currency id |

| Category      |
| ------------- |
| id            |
| category name |

| Record           |
| ---------------- |
| id               |
| user id          |
| category id      |
| date of creation |
| sum              |
| currency id      |

## Testing

To test the program you must use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

### Edpoints

Creating new currency (*required - currency_name*):

    /currency

Creating new user (*required - user_name, user_currency*):

    /user

Updating user default currency (*required - user_currency*):

    /user/<user_id_value>

Creating new category (*required - category_name*):

    /category

Creating new record (*required - user_id, category_id, record_sum, not mandatory - record_currency*):

    /record

Getting currencies:

    /currency

Getting currency by id:

    /currency/<currency_id_value>

Getting users:

    /user

Getting user by id:

    /user/<user_id_value>

Getting categories:

    /category

Getting category by id:

    /category/<category_id_value>

Geting records:

    /record
    /record?user_id=<value>
    /record?user_id=<value>&category_id=<value>

Getting record by id:

    /record/<record_id_value>

### Storages and ORM Models

The program can work with object storages and ORM models as databases. The deployed version uses ORM models, but you can manually use test object storage. To do so, you can:

- Commenting each manager call with _orm at the end *(example - category_orm)*
- Uncommenting each manager call with _storage at the end calls *(example - category_storage)*. 

This should be done in every module of package backend.resources

If you wish to return to ORM models, revert the changes
